Created a simple ToDoApp that can do the following:
1) Add items using an editable text field. 
2) Long click on an item to delete it.
3) Normal click an item to edit it. This opens a new Activity with the cursor at the end of the text. The edited text goes back in the same position of the original list.
4) Persist the data and reload from persisted data.
